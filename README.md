## Ask a question

Asking a question is as easy as creating a new [issue](https://github.com/vinorodrigues/vinorodrigues.github.io/issues) on this project.

I'll try to answer it soon-ish. Once I answer I'll close the issue just so I know what I've answered - but if you have any further questions just respond in the same thread.

Just remember your comments will be public in perpetuity.
